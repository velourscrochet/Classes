Teenage Brains Are Malleable And Vulnerable, Researchers Say

 In the case of Joseph Stalin, much energy has been devoted to discussing
 the possibility of a personality disorder stemming from his conflicted
 childhood.
 Given the circumstances surrounding his family, during his upbringing in
 the town of Gori, it makes sense that his parents could be so divided on
 his upbringing.
 His father Beso, expecting Joseph to lead a stable, working class life
 as he did, would expect the certainty of a steady wage during hard times.
 His mother, Keke, hoped that he could leave the current conditions, for
 a better life than that found in their poor home.
 It is understandable, though no less reprehensible, that his childhood
 was very harsh.

Given that there are no copies of this novel available in English, it is
 reasonable to assume that any description of the plot is, in the very best
 of cases, a summary of a translation of a summary.
 Because of this, many synopses are inaccurate, or more commonly, misrepresentat
ive of the story line, retelling minor details as major plot elements.
 The worst offender is quite possibly Montefiore, who in Young Stalin describes
 how Koba “fights against the Russians, sacrificing everything for his wife
 and country”

 In the story, as we will soon see, Koba has a girlfriend (Marina), but
 no wife.
 He does not fight for his country, but rather against the officers who
 locked his friend Iago in jail, and forced Iago's love Nunu to marry against
 her will.
 To claim that the fight was only incidentally against the Cossack rulers
 would be unfair; however to claim that the entire book was “a sacrifice
 for his country” is equally misleading.

At the start of the book, the story consists of two “holy” goals – true
 love, and the free will to acquire it.

 An arranged marriage was entirely unacceptable.

 There is white, and there is black.

In Stalin’s government, and indeed the USSR as a whole, there were loyal
 Bolsheviks, and there were enemies and spies.
 There was nothing in between; any failure to comply with his philosophy
 on life must in fact be a traitor to the cause.
 It could not be human error, uncertainty, or inability to comply.
 It was only treason, and the punishment for being an enemy of the state
 was severe.
 As Service mentions, Stalin usually believed his own misrepresentation
 of the world around him.
 “If ever he called somebody a traitor, it was not only the mind of others
 he was manipulating”

 Stalin would read of it.
 During this time, Russia sought to expand south through the Caucasus, first
 through brutal military assault, and later through continual occupation
 of military forces.
 The Russians also introduced their own Governors, removing any election
 by the people of the region.
 Unsurprisingly, these intruders were disliked by all.

At the beginning, Diambeg was a captain of the Cossack guard.
 While in this position, he locked Glaha away in order to attempt to woo
 Nunu's mother.
 When this was unsuccessful he rapes her, and Glaha swears vengeance on
 Diambeg.
 This is the first instance of a vow of vengeance in this story; the tangible
 result of a strong moral system, a Georgian who swears to get revenge will
 do so or die trying.
 Once Diambeg was moved up to the position of Governor, Glaha realized the
 futility of his vow.
 He hides away in shame, in cowardice, for failing to live up to his words.

Girgola is the current Cossack captain serving under Diambeg, and he is

 It is very surprising to the aunt and uncle of Nunu when it is Girgola

 (who he is known to beat regularly).
 Girgola claims unconvincingly that Nunu would be married to his brother,
 and the deal is made.
 The ransom is exchanged at once, to secure the deal.

The abrek was portrayed by Kazbegi as a Robin Hood character, stealing from
 the rich and giving to the needy -- in this case the Chechen militants,
 who were holding their ground.
 Abreks historically went on to battle the Russian occupants in harsh guerrilla
 warfare during the Caucasian War, later attaining a sort of

 status.
 In some ways, the traditional abrek was more akin to Stalin than was his
 beloved Koba in particular.
 Koba simply happens upon, towards the end of the storyline, the Chechen
 rebels, whereas the mythical abrek character has been devoted to the cause
 from the start.
 While abreks were traditionally no more aligned with their friends than
 their foes, in the war they did choose a side: the side of the oppressed
 peasant class.
 Iremashvili claimed that

 This, however visible, was a side-plot in the story.

 devotion to the abrek lifestyle than did the text of Kazbegi's novel itself.

 The tradition of joining as blood brothers is very particular; it involves
 exchanging bullets, hugging three times, and kissing three times.
 When a man has become your blood brother, you may never foresake him; he
 has become at least as important to you as your own brother.

 you, and Koba is wary of old friends who are not his blood brother, when

 for his seat of power.
 Once it seemed as though his control was at risk, Stalin did anything necessary

 This passage installs a framework, under which any action is permissible,

 This time she is locked in his house, with no food and water for days.
 His manservant breaks her out and hides Nunu away with his wife.

Koba and Iago are being protected by the hunters' village, but they are
 both desperate for news of Nunu.
 While hunting in the woods, Koba runs into Girgola's manservant, who recognizes
 him and brings him to visit Nunu.
 The men decide to smuggle Nunu to the town of Dzaug, where her father can
 hide her away until they bring Iago out to find her.
 However, Koba believes it to be impossible to fight through the ring of
 guards surrounding their current hiding place.
 The manservant explains that sometimes cunning is more effective than brute
 force, and they make plans to smuggle Nunu out under a cartful of hay.

During this conversation, an old acquaintance of Koba's (Vep'hiya) visits,
 bringing news of the Chechen militia.
 He joins Koba's brigand, and brings them in contact with the

One notable scene while hunting involves two deer battling, knocking their
 antlers together.
 Koba is fascinated by the honor with which the deer wait the proper amount
 of time before striking again; that one could kill the other easily by
 striking early, yet this never happens, impresses upon him the nobility
 of the animal kingdom.
 This could be read as a metaphor for the nobility of the lower classes
 as well.
 It would not be a stretch to say that those who worked the earth are closer
 to nature, and that Kazbegi meant to directly remind the reader of the
 honor of the mountain folk in the Caucasus.
 It is the men who have simple lives who are most unfettered by the sins
 of the rich and powerful.
 It is certainly possible to read this as yet another strike against the
 upper class.

It is not until Vep'hiya arrives that Koba and Iago, or even the reader,
 are fully aware of the happenings in the rest of the Caucasus, surrounding
 the Khevi region.
 Suddenly the small struggle between our characters, good and evil, is mapped
 onto the greater scale.
 The Cossacks have always been Russian, and the abreks have always been
 Georgian, but it is now clear that a larger, more important battle is at
 hand.

As Stalin was a Georgian, raised in the aftermath of the Caucasian War,
 he felt the full force of nationalism upon him in his childhood.
 He and his friends smuggled in Georgian nationalist books and poetry to
 the seminary (such as 
\emph on
The Patricide
\emph default
), and Stalin even wrote his own nationalist poetry under a pseudonym.

 He even led his own version of the raids mentioned in the novel, in order
 to collect for the rising Bolshevik party, on behalf of Georgia.

 Although it was known that Stalin supported Marxism on a wide scale in
 the USSR, Lenin was concerned that he favored Georgia above other Soviet
 states for many years.

 He did, in fact, continue to promote actions which would cause Georgia
 to fall under his axiomatic definition of a nation, described in 
\emph on
Marxism and the National Question
\emph default
.
 That is, he encouraged the printing of Georgian literary classics, while
 his definition of nationhood requires a vigorous press and literature.
 In contrast to Ukraine and Belorussia, where he crushed new literature
 and culture, it is clear that Stalin was a Georgian nationalist even through
 the 1930s.

Nunu reconnects with her father, and remains hidden away.
 When Koba and Iago come to find her, only Koba is able to discern Glaha's
 identity.
 He returns with the good news, and the group makes plans to reconnect.
 There is a curfew each night, imposed by the Cossacks, so Koba's group
 is crawling under a bridge when they overhear their host telling some Cossack
 troops that he has found Koba and Iago.
 The news quickly gets back to Girgola.
 He is at first gleeful, that he has finally captured the rebels.
 The next moment, he hears news that Nunu is in town as well.
 Girgola had been informed that she was dead, so he was shocked.
 While it is one thing to give up on your tortured love because she is in
 ruins at the bottom of a river, it is quite another to be ridiculed again
 as she is stolen away by Iago, to live happily ever after.
 Girgola is filled with

Girgola gathers his men to burn Iago and his group out of the building they
 are locked into.
 They are fired upon, and then the building is surrounded by hay and set
 aflame, killing everyone inside.
 Everyone, that is, except for Koba.
 As the town is watching the fire, a man arrives to report a murder of the
 old beggar, Glaha.
 The only suspect, Girgola declares, is Nunu.
 He holds a show trial, where she is banished to a life of hard labor in
 Siberia.
 She swears to God that she is innocent, and the townspeople are confused.

As Diambeg and Girgola ride back home the next day, Girgola is haunted by
 the pained face of Nunu.
 All of a sudden each is shot off of his horse.
 A shout rang out, as Koba approached on horseback, proudly proclaiming
 his presence.
 Diambeg died instantly, but Girgola had enough time to call for a priest.
 With his dying breath, he begs forgiveness for framing Nunu with Patricide.

The second passage, that is most likely to have been influential on young
 Joseph, is this last page.
 The direct comparisons of torture, killing the innocent with the enemies,
 and show trials are ironic, but I find it unlikely that he considered them
 worth mentioning.
 The line of import is that which is uttered by Koba, as he triumphantly
 brings down the enemy of the people.
 The line which proclaims his oath of vengeance a success: Это я, Коба!
 За жизнь Иаго вы расплачиваетесь!
