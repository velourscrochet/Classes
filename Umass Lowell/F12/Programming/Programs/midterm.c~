//1)  Write a macro, MIN5 (A, B, C, D, E), which takes five arguments and returns smallest value.

#define MIN5(A, B, C, D, E) 	{										\
					((A) >= (B)) && ((A) >= (C)) && ((A) >= (D)) && ((A) >= (E)) ? (A) :	\
					((B) >= (A)) && ((B) >= (C)) && ((B) >= (D)) && ((B) >= (E)) ? (B) :	\
					((C) >= (A)) && ((C) >= (B)) && ((C) >= (D)) && ((C) >= (E)) ? (C) :	\
					((D) >= (A)) && ((D) >= (B)) && ((D) >= (C)) && ((D) >= (E)) ? (D) :	\
					(E)									\
				}

//2)  Write a function, word_count, which will determine how many words are in a given string.

int word_count (char * s)
{
/**************************************************************************/
/*                        Function word_count			          */

/*  Purpose:     Determines how many words are in the string              */
/*                                                                        */
/*  Parameters: string - Input string, to count words in		  */

/*  Returns:    num_words - Number of words counted			  */
/**************************************************************************/

int num_words;		//Number of words counted

printf("%c",s)

return (num_words);
}


//3)  Write a function that is passed a month, day, and year and will determine if
//     that date is valid.  You can choose the type and format of the date values used 
//     in the function parameters.   Remember to check for leap year!



//4)  Write a function to determine if a given number is a PRIME number,
//     that is, a number that is only divisible by itself.

//5)  A perfect number is one, all of whose divisors (except itself) sum
//    to the number.  Thus, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors,
//    3, 2, and 1, add to 6.  On the other hand, 8 is not because 4, 2,
//    and one only sum to 7.  Write a function, perfect, which will take an
//    integer value and determine if it is a perfect number.

//6)  A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same forward as it does backward.
//     Write a function,  palindrome, that will determine if a given string is a palindrome.

//7)  Write a function that will return in a structure the following 
//     characteristics of a given string:  1) string length (use strlen),
//     2) number of upper case characters, 3) number of lower case characters,
//     4) number of digits, and 5) number of non-alphanumeric characters.

//8)  Write a function myBaseBallStats that is passed the following integer stats on a baseball player:

/*          Number of Singles, Doubles, Triples, and Home Runs as well as Number of At Bats.

     Based on this information, return a structure that contains the following

          Total Bases, Batting Average, Home Run Ratio, and Slugging Average.

     You do not need to be a baseball fan to do this ... All the information you need in 
     terms of the formulas and explanations can be found at:

           http://www.baseball-almanac.com/stats.shtml

     Note:  Number of hits is:  singles + doubles + triples + home runs*/

/*9) Most people enjoy watching movies these days, whether its the classics or modern ones.   
      Develop a set of structures that could be used to model the information about a movie collection.   
      What type of information would you want to collect and store about a movie?   What would be the right 
      types in C for that information?  Define supporting structures as needed and have one final structure type that 
      is made up of various members (some members may be on some structure type, others may be simple integers, 
      floats, chars, arrays, etc).   No progam is needed.   This question is similar to the final question on the midterm, but
      now you have learned about many different types since then.*/
